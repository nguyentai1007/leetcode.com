Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

C#
public class Solution {
    public char FindTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0;
        foreach (int a in s.ToCharArray())
            i ^= a;
        foreach (int a in t.ToCharArray())
            i ^= a;
        return (char) i;
    }
}
