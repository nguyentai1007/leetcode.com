Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
Example 3:

Input: 218
Output: false
Hint : 
An integer will be power of 2 only if it has only one bit set and n-1 will give us all but the MSB set . Hence its & will give a zero if its a power of 2 .

C#
public class Solution {
    public bool IsPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n>0 && (n&(n-1))==0;
    }
}
