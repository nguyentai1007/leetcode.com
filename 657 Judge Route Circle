Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false

bool judgeCircle(char* moves) {
    int x,y;
    x = y = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i< strlen(moves); i++)
        switch (moves[i]){
            case 'L': x--; break;
            case 'R': x++; break;
            case 'U': y++; break;
            case 'D': y--; break;
        }    
    return (x==0 && y==0);
}
